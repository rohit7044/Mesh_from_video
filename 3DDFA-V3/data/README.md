# Introduction

 - Our method for facial expression synthesis is capable of generating the desired expressions in a controlled, large-scale, and rapid manner. Currently, we have generated more than 500K samples of expression data. Examples are provided below:

 - Please note that there may be some incorrect expressions in the data, and the users should filter them according to their own needs. We will soon release a demo script for expression augmentation (only for research usage).
 - We recommend [this](https://github.com/hhj1897/face_pose_augmentation) for additional face pose data augmentation.
